title: Motor System Improvements
description: Improvements we would like to add to the motor system.
---

These are the things we would like to implement:

- [Use a different policy for learning than for inference](motor-system-improvements/enable-policy-switching-learning-vs-inference.md) #learning
- [Bottom-Up exploration policy for surface agent](motor-system-improvements/bottom-up-exploration-policy-for-surface-agent.md) #learning
- [Top-down exploration policy](motor-system-improvements/top-down-exploration-policy.md) #learning #numsteps
- [Bottom up policies for distant agent](motor-system-improvements/bottom-up-policies-for-distant-agent.md) #numsteps
- [Calculate saliency map in view finder and use it to saccade to region of interest ](motor-system-improvements/implement-efficient-saccades-driven-by-model-free-and-model-based-signals.md)#numsteps #multiobj
- [Learn policy using RL](motor-system-improvements/learn-policy-using-rl.md) (using simplified action space) #numsteps
- [Decompose goals into subgoals & communicate](motor-system-improvements/decompose-goals-into-subgoals-communicate.md) #goalpolicy
- [Interprete goal states in motor system & switch policies](motor-system-improvements/interpret-goal-states-in-motor-system-switch-policies.md) #goalpolicy

Please see the [instructions here](project-roadmap.md#how-you-can-contribute) if you would like to tackle one of these tasks.
